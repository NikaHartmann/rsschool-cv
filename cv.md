I want to improve my frontend's skills, because I like it. I'm studying at university now for web-designer and I have a lot of tasks, which related with frontend development. I know well HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is very difficult for me. So I here and ready improve my skills. In future I'm going to be a web-designer and I think to knowing frontend development will be only plus.

While studying I made tree projects, which I made with html, css and js. I used plugins, frameworks and libraries. One of those projects, I placed on GitHub (https://NikaHartmann.github.io/project/).

My experience: I've finished the university like menedjer in tourism and hospitality(BGUFK) and I'm studying at university(BGU) like web-designer now. I've finished courses WAY-UP, few courses Bang Bang Education and I'm studying course English in the StrimLine.

English language level - pre-intermediate.
